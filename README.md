# CS 455 Artificial Intelligence Final Project

This project is a program that is designed to stabilized satellites. 

## Introduction

These instructions will provide you which tools and modules needed for the project run on your local machine
for viewing and testing purposes.

### Module/Library Prerequisites

	1.	matplotlib
	2.	itertools
	3.	numpy
	4.	random
	5.	scipy
	6.	control
	7.	sys
	8.	os


### Installing

Ideally, Anaconda3's Jupyter will provide you with the modules that you need, however, if you using an alternative method to use
this program, please view the instructions below. :

The following was performed on a Windows 10 Operating System.

You must download the latest version of python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
The pip module will be installed along with Python's IDLE

To install any module, you will follow a couple of simple instructions:

	Open your Command Prompt and enter the following: python -m pip install -U <name_of_module>
	Press ENTER and installation will begin (and finish)

	Here are the CMD commands to use when pip is installed:
		
		python -m pip install -U matplotlib
		python -m pip install -U itertools
		python -m pip install -U numpy
		python -m pip install -U scipy

That's It! The other modules are not included because they are default in the IDLE IDE

## Execution

In the zip folder, the source code is provided as a jupyter notebook for the user to observe and interact with the group's program.
Using this program with Jupyter via Anaconda Suite provides the user with pre-installed module that the environment has access to for
the program to run without error.

## Built With

* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* Python IDLE (3.7)
* Anaconda3 Suite

## Contributing

	Built with Sayan Chatterjee for the Satellite Class and Marcell Gilliam for the Genetic Algorithm Class
	Python for Control Purposes by Prof. Roberto Bucher was used to help construct the Satellite Class
	Special thanks to Dr. Richard Stansbury for teaching and mentoring in regards to this project.
